<h1>
    A Generative App for DND Fans and Players
</h1>

The purpose of this app to to showcase the ability to create a web app utilizing an AI
<br></br>
In this application I am able to demonstrate the use of python Flask in a NodeJS and React application.
The application will be usable on both desktop as well as mobile. The key features of this application
is to show the use of python REST API endpoints using the Flask library and integrating multiple AI models
used from Hugging Face.
<br></br>
Models used in this application are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Text-To-Image Generation: <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-cascade" target="_blank">stablilityai/stable-cascade</a></li>
    <li>Image-To-Video: *Research in progress*</li>
    <li>Text-To-Speech: *Research in progress*</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
Together the application allows for the generation of images from text prompts, the generation of videos from either input images
or through the direct pipe of generated images to video, and the generation of VOs from text.
The starting idea was to have an app for Dungeons and Dragons players and fans to generate content for campaigns that  brought
their ideas and creations to life. Use of the app will be free of charge however the trade off will be the speed of generation
based on determination of funding for resources.
